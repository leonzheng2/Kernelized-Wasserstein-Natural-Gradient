# Kernelized-Wasserstein-Natural-Gradient
Implementation of "Arbel, M., Gretton, A., Li, W., Montufar, G. (2019) Kernelized Wasserstein Natural Gradient".

# Structure

Classes for implementation of Kernelized Wasserstein Natural Gradient is in ``src/``.

Reproduced experiments are given in ``exp/``. Run the different Python files after choosing the parameters to get the results of the experiments.
